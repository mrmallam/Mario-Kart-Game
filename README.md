This game consists of 4 different challenges with different difficulties. 

Mario starts at the initial position and moves across the screen to collect the key in order to advance to the next challenge.

Upon finishing all 4 challenges, if the player manages to collect all 4 keys, a “Game Won!” screen will be displayed congratulating the player.

Each of the challenges contain 3 value packs that disappear if taken:
Red heart: increases the player’s lives by one
Black heart: decreases the player’s lives by one
Coin: increases player’s score by 5 points

Each of the challenges contain moving obstacles that decrease the remaining lives by one and returns Mario to the starting position upon colliding with them.
Challenge 1: Moving obstacles are horizontal.
Challenge 2: Moving obstacles are vertical.
Challenge 3: Moving obstacles are diagonal from top right to button left.
Challenge 4: Moving obstacles are diagonal from button left to top right.

In the event that the player has no remaining lives, or the allowed game time has finished, a “Game Over!” screen will be displayed with an option to restart the game or to terminate.
